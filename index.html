    <h1>Rush 2112</h1>
   
    <p>Epic. And perhaps deserving of a bit of attention, all these years later [released 1976].</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a comically pretentious, futuristic rock opera written by a nerdy
      drummer and sung by a whiny-voiced geek.</li>
      <li>The result is an absolutely blistering first track (originally an
      &lsquo;album side&rsquo;) and as clear-sighted a hymn to individual
      freedom and nonconformity as rock has ever seen.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Two views, very little common ground [both from the same amazon.com
    page]</p>


    <h2>The Band</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geddy Lee</strong>: bass guitar, vocals, acoustic guitar, synthesizer</li>
	<li><strong>Alex Lifeson</strong>: acoustic and electric guitars</li>
	<li><strong>Neil Pert</strong>: drums, percussion, words</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At this point in his career, Geddy Lee had an extremely high voice and was often screaming.</p>

    <h2>The Text</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The inspiration behind it was &hellip; it ended up being quite
      similar to a book called <cite>Anthem</cite> by the writer <strong>Ayn
      Rand</strong>.  But I didn't realize that while I was working on it
      &hellip;&rdquo;<br /> 
      -Neil Pert</p>
    </blockquote>

<div id="lyrics">

<p>&ldquo;I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky
become one, merging into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin
Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I used
to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine for the
day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric
domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving
planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The
less fortunate gave us a few new moons.  I believed what I was told. I thought
it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found something that changed
it all &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IV. Presentation</strong></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re saying<br />
These things just can&rsquo;t be true<br />
Our world could use this beauty<br />
Just think what we might do<br />
Listen to my music<br />
And hear what it can do<br />
There&rsquo;s something here as strong as life<br />
I know that it will reach you</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t annoy us further!<br />
We have our work to do<br />
Just think about the average<br />
What use have they for you?<br />
Another toy will help destroy<br />
The elder race of man<br />
Forget about your silly whim<br />
It doesn&rsquo;t fit the Plan!</p>

   <h2>Condensed</h2>

   <p>For this 5 minute presentation, I compressed the 20 minutes of music into
   1 minute using the magic of digital signal processing [different from
   playing a tape or record at a faster speed]. You can find the file
   below.</p>
